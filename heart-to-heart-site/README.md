# Heart to Heart — static site

This folder contains your updated site with three working images.  
Upload the **index.html** and the **assets/** folder to your GitHub Pages (or any static host).

## Files
- `index.html` — updated to point to image paths under `assets/`.
- `assets/beach.jpg` — your beach photo.
- `assets/love-cake.jpg` — the red cake with "i ❤ you".
- `assets/website.png` — the screenshot you attached.

> If you prefer a different third image (e.g., the snowman), send it to me and I'll swap it in.
